## Diktor Language Pack (fork)

This repository is an unofficial fork of AnySoftKeyboard/LanguagePack (Apache-2.0),
trimmed down to a single add-on: the Diktor Russian layout pack.

- Upstream (deprecated mono-repo): https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/LanguagePack
- Main project: https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard (addons/languages)

### Whatâ€™s included
- `api` and `base` libraries from ASK add-on SDK
- `languages/diktor`: Diktor pack (pack + apk)
- Optional: `languages/english` may exist locally as a reference, but only Diktor participates in the build.

### Build
- Debug APK:
```
./gradlew :languages:diktor:apk:assembleDebug
```
Result APK will also be copied to `add_ons_apks/debug/`.

- Release APK: configure signing (do not commit keystores)
  - Optionally set a unique applicationId in `languages/diktor/apk/build.gradle`:
    `ext.override_app_id = "com.yourorg.ask.languagepack.diktor"`

### Credits & License
- Original authors: AnySoftKeyboard contributors (Apache License 2.0)
- This fork modernizes the build and provides Diktor-specific layouts and resources.
